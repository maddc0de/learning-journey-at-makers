## Reflections

Points that resonated with me the most in the retro:

1. Keep Doing..  'Keep going! Keep turning up!'

2. Less of.. 'comparing myself to others'

3. More of.. 'Git commits'

4. Start doing.. 'Feeling comfortable with not being in control of everything'

5. Stop doing.. 'Beating myself up! We are learning and should remember that that means making mistakes and getting stuck'
