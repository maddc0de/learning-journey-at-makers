## Reflections

### 21st March

Wanting to ensure a solid understanding of the coding process and gain more confidence on the current topic, I took the time to review the exercise on test-driving a Multi Class System. This has then paid off during today's pair-programming session as I was able to keep up with the code.

### 23rd March

Attending the Multi-class system workshop proved to be beneficial, prompting me to reevaluate my approach to test-driving a multi-class system exercise.

I have also taken more breaks during pair-programming, which ultimately improved my focus and mood a lot.

### 24th March

Points that resonated with me the most in the retro:

1. What went well this week?  'I finally see the point of TDD'

2. What didn't go well this week? 'Mocking/complex doubles for more complex cases is still somewhat confusing'

3. Shout out to the team 'Peer group was a source of pure positive wellbeing'

4. Action points for the future 'Follow pair programming driver-navigator roles more closely'

## Useful Tips

One of my key takeaways from the EQ Workshop about feedback is maybe using a framework, **ASK**, when giving feedback. This stands for: Actionable, Specific and Kind.
