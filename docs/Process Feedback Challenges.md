# Process Feedback Challenges

-----

Challenges that we have to complete during the Maker's course where we have to record ourselves completing these challenges to show and share our thinking process.
The coaches will then give us some feedback on our engineering practices.

## How this is done

1. **Open up a Zoom call.**  

2. **Share my screen.**  
   Ensuring that I share all of my screen or at least all of the parts I will be using as part of the exercise.

3. **Turn on audio if we want to share your thinking.**  

4. **Start recording from the zoom call.**  

5. **Do the exercise.**

6. **Leave the call when finished with the exercise for the recording to be processed.**  

7. **Upload the recording to the link they have given in the materials**
