# Code Review

The Review is an hour-long remote session conducted via Zoom. The reviewer roleplays as a product owner with a set of non-technical requirements. The developer uses the Makers dev process to convert these requirements into a working, tested, well-written application. 

The Review assesses how well a developer:

* Converts fuzzy, human wants and needs into technical requirements,
* Writes good tests,
* Writes clean code,
* Debugs when things go wrong,
* Delivers value to the customer in an Agile way.

A review will then give extensive written feedback on process and how programming problems were tackled.
