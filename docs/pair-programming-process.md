## GitHub collaboration
Example process: 
1. Pair partner Alice creates a project repo on their computer. For example, fizbuzz.
2. Alice makes a commit.
3. Alice creates a fizbuzz repo on GitHub.
4. Alice pushes her commit to her GitHub repo.
5. Alice invites pair partner Bob as a collaborator on her GitHub repo.
6. Bob accepts the invitation. (This is important - it lets Bob get his green contribution squares.)
7. Bob clones (not forks) Alice's repository.
8. Bob can add commits to his clone and push them to Alice's GitHub repo.

The next day
9. Bob is now working with a new pair partner, Chetna.
10. Bob creates a fizbuzz-2 repo on his GitHub account.
11. Bob changes the origin remote on his local clone from the day before to point at his fizbuzz-2 repo on GitHub.
12. Bob can now push new commits from his local clone to fizbuzz-2.
13. Bob adds Chetna as a collaborator. She can now clone and contribute to his repo.
