# Induction

From the moment you read this sentence, you are a software engineer.

Welcome to our field. We're glad to have you. Software has transformed the world
over the past decades. This has done a great deal of good and opened up many
opportunities. It has also created a whole new class of problems.

So there's plenty of work to be done, and someone out there is waiting for you
to do it.

Let's get started.

This is your induction. There are two parts:

1. **The induction workshop.**
   Your coach will take you through this. You can review the contents below.

2. **The induction checklist.**
   You'll do this independently.

## Induction Workshop

Your coach will take you through this, so you don't need to review this section
unless you want to. [Click here to go to the Induction

4. [Mutual expectations](#mutual-expectations)
5. [Schedule](#schedule)
6. [Get started](#get-started)

### Getting to know each other

Your coach will put you into break-out rooms in pairs for ten minutes. At the
end, you'll come back and introduce your partner to the rest of the group.

Ask each other these questions:

1. **What is your name? How is it pronounced? What pronouns should we refer to you by?**
   Pronouns are words like [she](https://pronoun.is/she),
   [he](https://pronoun.is/he), or [they](https://pronoun.is/they). If you don't
   understand what this means it's OK. If you'd prefer not to talk about it, you
   can say "I don't mind."

2. **What did you do before this?**
   Some people might have come straight from school, some might have had long
   careers before. Both are interesting!

3. **What music/television/books/games have you been enjoying lately?**
   Pick one. No wrong answers here!

You might want to keep notes so you can remember everything to introduce your
partner when we come back.

### What you're preparing for

Your coach will talk to you about what software engineering jobs are like
day-to-day. They will draw out some key points:

- **Real-world software is big.**
  You will have come across small programs, and in this course you will work
  mostly on small programs. But in the real world, software is big. A typical
  project may include hundreds of files, and fifty or so database tables,
  servers, and engineers working on it at one time in multiple languages.

  Your training will be on simple systems at first, to train the core
  engineering practices that will prepare you to work in large systems. Don't
  lose sight of this and assume your job is just to solve simple problems.

- **You will keep learning forever.**
  Software engineering moves very fast and has a lot of detail. You won't learn
  even a small fraction of it here. What you will learn are some core
  engineering practices, including those necessary to keep learning efficiently
  and effectively.

- **You will work closely with other people.**
  Software engineers, contrary to public perception, do not work alone any more
  than the people who construct spacecraft work alone. They work as part of a
  team which takes time and effort to keep coordinated. Part of your training
  will be the core engineering practices necessary to take part in this sort of
  endeavour.

### Mutual expectations

Your coach will talk you through what you can expect from them, and what they
will expect from you in return.

#### Timekeeping

You can expect your coach to be available to you as a group from 9.30am–12.30pm.
There may be some days this will differ, which you can expect your coach to let
you know.

We expect you to start work at 9.30am, and to finish at 5.30pm. We suggest you take an hour for lunch from 12.30pm to 1.30pm though this can be flexible, but expect you to be ready
to start work again by 2pm. 

Your coach will start all group sessions at 5 minutes past the stated start
time. We expect you to be present by that time.

Throughout the course, there will be mandatory weekend challenges that we expect you to work on. How long developers spend on these vary, but you should aim to set aside around 6 hours altogether across the weekend to work on these. Completion is less important than attempting the challenges, as they will typically have you practice the very important developer skill of breaking down a set of user stories. 

If you foresee any obstacles to your being able to keep to these times please
contact your coach. If you need to tell us that you will be absent on any
particular day, please message Demi on Slack. 

#### Engagement

Between 9.30am-12.30pm you can expect your coach to be present and interested in
helping you progress in your learning. You can expect that they will guide you
in this and help you stay focused on learning rather than other natural concerns
like succeeding at every exercise or comparing yourself to others in the group.

We expect you to stay focused on your learning every day. This means pursuing
the learning objectives of each module. We don't expect you to complete all
exercises or read all material, so long as you are achieving the learning
objectives.

#### Consulting

You can expect your coach to consult with you on how to help you learn. They
will ask questions and give you options.

We expect you to let us know when you are learning and when you aren't, to
contribute to discussions, and to discuss your learning with each other. We
expect that you will respond to our questions in sessions in the spirit of being
present, and on Slack within an hour or two.

If you're not feeling up to speaking in a particular session, please send your
coach a private message on Zoom to say this. You can expect that they will
respect this.

#### Wellbeing

We expect you to take care of yourself and others. You will succeed the best if
you do what it takes to stay well and be kind to those around you.

In return, you can expect us to respect your wellbeing and be responsive to what
you tell us in order to preserve and improve the way you feel studying with us.

#### Conduct

In order to maintain a professional and respectful environment, we have a [Code
of Conduct](https://makers.tech/code-of-conduct/). We expect you to abide by
this. If you feel someone has breached the code of conduct, you can mention it
to them directly or tell us and we will discuss what action might be
appropriate.

#### Safety

To learn you have to be safe. If you feel unsafe or in danger at any point,
speak to your coach, any member of Makers staff, or email
safeguarding@makers.tech. This email is monitored 9am – 5pm Monday to Friday
excluding Bank Holidays. Outside of these hours, you can contact the Samaritans
on 116 123 or Mind on 0300 123 3393. This includes if you feel your mental state
is becoming unmanageable, if you are at risk due to something in your home, or
if you experience any harassment from anyone during your study or work.

You can expect us to take anything you tell us about your safety seriously and
proportionately.

### Schedule

_This is a new schedule as of April 2023._

Most modules in the programme will follow the following schedule.

_Note, if your cohort is a hybrid or office-based cohort, please substitute the
'call' below for being in the office._

* **09.30–10.00: Peer Group Check-in**  
  Learners and coaches join a call at 9.30 to start the day. Usually, after a
  short word from your coach, you'll join a group of your peers to discuss how
  things went yesterday and your plans for today.

* **10.00–12.00: Shift A (Coaches Present)**  
  At Makers our days are organised into three shifts. In each shift, you will
  have the work of your current module to get on with. Many modules will also
  have workshops and they will typically be booked into these shifts. A coach
  will also be present and ready to discuss anything you'd like to talk about to
  assist with your learning.

  A typical Shift A might have a workshop from 10.00–10.45, followed by time for
  you work through the module material or follow-up any research you'd like to
  engage with. If you got stuck, for example at 11.30, you might drop into the
  coaches room for some help.

* **12.00–13.00: Lunch**  
  We recommend you have your lunch and take a break at this time.

* **13.00–15.00: Shift B (Independent)**  
  For Shift B you will work either independently or in pairs depending on the
  module — your coach will explain to you which it is.

  Note that coaches aren't around during this shift. This is deliberate, to give
  you practice of your future job where there probably won't be coaches around
  to help you all of the time. If you get stuck, see how far your independent
  problem solving skills can take you and then check in with a coach later in
  the day.

* **15.00–17.00: Shift C (Coaches Present)**  
  In Shift C you will continue on the independent or pairing work you started in
  Shift B. However your coach will also be on the call. They will be using the
  time to check in with people and see how they are getting on, so they won't
  be in the coaches room all of the time. 
  
  If you'd like them to drop into your room soon just send them a Slack message
  and they'll aim to make time.

* **17.00–17.30: Wind-down Time**  
  This is time to close off your work for the day. Finish what you're doing and
  finalise any notes, admin, or submissions you had to do that day.

  After that, finish your day and have a well-earned rest!

We're expecting you to be either on your the Zoom call for the full duration of
the three shifts. Feel free to take breaks as needed, but treat it as a full
working day.

### Get Started

Do the induction checklist below.

After you've done that, get started with the [Golden Square
module.](https://github.com/makersacademy/golden-square)

## Induction Checklist

Complete each of the items in this list.

Access or setup issues here aren't uncommon. If you can't complete a step for
any reason, send your coach a Slack message to let them know and move onto the
next item. Come back to the incomplete items on Friday to try again.

- [ ] Complete your Slack profile:
  - [ ] Add your preferred name.
  - [ ] Add your name's pronunciation in the "Name pronunciation" field.
  - [ ] Add your pronouns.
  - [ ] Add a photo of you.  
        If you don't want to add a photo, add an illustration that looks a bit
        like you. Don't put a cat or a dolphin because we won't know who you are.
  - [ ] Add some details to the "About Me" section.
    - [ ] Add your cohort.
    - [ ] Add a short bio to About Me.
- [ ] Put your name on your Github account.
- [ ] (Optionally) Write a short [personal statement](#personal-statement) and
      share it with your coach.
- [ ] Get started with the [Golden Square
module.](https://github.com/makersacademy/golden-square)

### Personal Statement (Optional)

Optionally, write a short personal statement to help your coach understand a bit more about
you and how to help you achieve what you have come here to achieve.

Here is a guide for some topics you might wish to cover:

- What has been your experience of software engineering so far — if any? How do
  you see this course relating to what you have learned?
- In what areas do you feel most confident? And where might you appreciate
  special assistance?
- In what areas do you feel the most interest? And the least?
- Tell me about one or two particularly meaningful incidents from your education
  or professional career. Tell me why you chose those episodes, and what did you
  learn?
- What are your plans for your career or life beyond this course? What would you
  like to achieve for yourself?
- Anything else you'd like to share.

In all of these areas, we would be equally happy to hear that you have only a
few ideas or a well developed sense of the future, or that you have prepared not
at all or a great deal!

Send this to your coach when you're done as a document file (a `.txt`, `.rtf`, `.pdf` or similar).
