## Learning Objectives:


- irb and how it is a REPL
- strings - define as an obj holding an arbitrary number of characters
- variables - define as assigned values using = operator
- methods: define as a way of automating ruby commands, DRY code
- BOOLEAN: everything in RUBY is ‘truthy’ except false or nil
- arrays: define as an indexed collection of related items
- CONTROL FLOW - define symbols as string-like objs are immutable, how is it memory efficient?
- HASHES: define as ‘dictionary’ or ‘associative array’
- BLOCKS: structure using both {} and do..end notation
- RECURSION: when a method calls itself, avoid infinite recursion loops. Use to avoid nested loops
- ASKING FOR USER INPUT: meaning of gets and sanitises input using chomp/chomp!
- GEMS: define as a reusable ruby library, scenarios where its used and where to find gems
- LAMBDAS: anonymous methods, use to solve basic metaprogramming problems
- PROCS: another ‘anonymous methods’, link procs with lambdas

## Tips and tricks
- PARALLEL ASSIGNMENT
- SHOVEL OPERATOR
- STRING INTERPOLATION
