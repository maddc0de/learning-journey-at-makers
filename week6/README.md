## Weekly Goals

* [x] Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
* [x] Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking programming.
* [x] Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.

## Plan

* complete phase one: basics of JavaScript
* work through phase two: challenges designed to help me learn how to use Javascript in a real application
* work on the solo challenge at the end of the week

## Reflections

Through trusting the learning process and diligently working through the module, I successfully achieved all the goals I set for myself at the beginning of the week. Although the Bowling Challenge presented a significant challenge, I am proud that I took on the task and submitted a pull request with my partial solution. In hindsight, I realize the importance of thorough planning and studying the rules of the game before diving into coding. Moving forward, I will make it a priority to enhance my planning process to ensure a more efficient and effective approach to problem-solving.

## Useful Tips

* [Learning a new language by translation](https://hackmd.io/kMNgXiPHQf2Q_P9A-tnS9A)
  * Following the flow and getting visibility: Understanding which part of the code are running and in which order
  * [Learning to Learn: The Ready Position](https://sjmog.github.io/posts/491_learning_to_learn_1/)
  * [Learning to read reference and technical guide material effectively](https://hackmd.io/F-pmnp3hRhePddmf3mnKGw)

* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html) tool

> help save the hassle of checking for missing semicolons, **Prettier** automatically add them where they're needed and makes sure code is properly formatted. To run it so it automatically formats JS files, you can run the following in any project directory:
>
> ```bash
> npx prettier --write .
> ```
>
> (you'll be prompted to install prettier if this is the first time you're running the command).
>
> If you don't want to overwrite files, but only check if they're properly formatted, you can use the `--check` option instead of `--write`.
