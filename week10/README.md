## Reflections

One of my primary objectives was to enhance my object-oriented design skills and improve the quality of my code. To achieve this, I dedicated significant time to planning and designing the classes for the bank tech test. Although I didn't fully meet all the acceptance criteria, I am pleased with the progress I made. It allowed me to apply good design principles and make thoughtful decisions regarding code organisation and structure.

Preparing for the code review was a nerve-wracking experience for me. However, I managed to gather myself and did better than I thought during the review. I approached the problem by breaking it down into smaller, manageable pieces and followed the red-green-refactor cycle. This iterative process ensured that I focused on writing just enough code to pass the tests during the Green phase and then refactored to improve the code's readability and maintainability. Going forward, I will remember to gather comprehensive information about the client's expectations and ask relevant questions to clarify expected behaviors past what have been mentioned in the brief and consider edge cases.
