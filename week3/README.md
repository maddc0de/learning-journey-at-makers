### Reflections

I did not meet all my goals set for this week. There was a lot of things out of my control that were taking up more of my time and if I could change something and what I would want to improve on moving forward, is to be kinder to myself.

I recalled on one of the EQ workshops where they said something about the course is more about learning than completion. Reflecting on my progress so far, I can confidently say that I have gained more knowledge today compared to what I knew last week.
