## Reflections

Despite the challenges we faced, we were able to have a complete MVP and was able to present our project because we prioritised the MVP features and worked towards completing them. By emphasising the importance of focusing on core functionalities first, we were able to make steady progress and ensure that everyone had a clear understanding of the essential components of the application. This allowed us to stay focused and deliver the core functionality of the application within the given timeframe. We also took the time to clean up the code and address any bugs or issues that arose, ensuring that our final product was of high quality and met the requirements.
