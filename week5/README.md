## Weekly Goals

* [x] Learn to work and communicate effectively as part of a team to build a web application.
* [x] Learn to break down projects into tasks and assign them to pairs
* [x] Learn to use agile ceremonies to organise your work and improve your processes.
* [x] Learn to use the developer workflow to plan, implement and peer-review features.

### Plan

* Turn the headline specifications into user stories and create one Trello ticket in the column "Backlog (all TODO)".
* Create a Trello board for the project
* Follow the suggested schedule for this week:

> Monday to Tuesday - Sprint #1
> Wednesday to Thursday - Sprint #2
> Friday - Sprint #3
> [Stand-up every morning](how_to_run_standup.md) (15mins)
> [Retro at the end of a sprint](how_to_run_team_retro.md)

## Reflections

During the first group engineering project, I experienced a significant amount of nervousness. However, attending the morning mediations proved to be beneficial, especially as they focused on managing performance anxiety. As a team, we unintentionally adopted the Waterfall method for project planning, which was a familiar and comfortable approach for me. Moving forward, I would like to challenge myself by adhering to a more agile methodology.

One of the initial challenges we faced was a lack of understanding regarding the file architecture, resulting in improper file connections and difficulties in making things work. Thankfully, with the support and guidance of my team members, I was able to learn from them and gain a better understanding of the codebase. This enabled me to successfully complete assigned tickets.

I also capitalized on my design skills and knowledge of Flexbox in CSS to contribute to the layout and styling of our web application. Leveraging this knowledge, I was able to enhance the overall aesthetic appeal of our project.

In the end, our team accomplished the goal of having a minimum viable product (MVP) and conducted an informal presentation and demo of our web application. It was a rewarding experience to see our efforts come together and witness the results of our collaborative work.

## Useful Tips

### To start first sprint

1. Get together as a team.
2. Pick a few tickets from the tickets backlog, and move them to the "Current sprint" column — remember your goal is to get them done within this first sprint, so it's better to start with less initially. For this first sprint, pick tickets relevant to the MVP of your project only. You can always extend the sprint with more tickets, if you find you're working faster than expected.
3. Assign the first tickets to pairs.
4. get into pairs
5. start planning MVP

### Minimum Viable Producr (MVP)

>The smallest thing that implements the core idea. Think about what this is for Airbnb. Build those user stories first. This MVP will not include many of the most exciting features in the specification.
>
>If your specification asks for a car, don't build the wheels in the first week, the doors in the second week, etc. The customer can't try it! Instead, build a skateboard in the first week.
>
>The MVP allows for an 'iterative' development of the project. That means that you try out a basic version of your project, get feedback on it, then use that feedback to improve the product or build new features. This ensures that what you are writing is very valuable to customers.
>
>Aim to get to your MVP by the end of Tuesday - this is the 'skateboard' of your project.

### Break down user stories into tasks

`As a X, so that i can Y, I want to do Z`

> Make sure each user story is small enough to be completable in less than half a day.

> Some items in the spec include more than one feature. e.g. "Any signed up user can list a new space". Break this into two user stories and prioritise the one that gets you as close as possible to a product.

> Use the customer's language (the domain language) in the user stories. Most words in the user stories should appear in the spec.

> Avoid splitting the work on the different "layers" of the program (e.g one pair working on the HTML view and one pair working on the Sinatra code). When working on a user story, you will have to work on all these different components — a feature will involve work on all the different layers of your web application.

### Creating tickets from the tasks

> A clear title, that includes a specific succinct description of the technical aspects of the ticket e.g. not "Make a homepage", but more like "Build a navigation bar".
>
> Include the user story as a starting point. This will bring focus to what the task is, and ensure that you have clarity of the end goal of the technical task i.e. the user's needs.
>
> Acceptance criteria is useful to answer some key questions to you should have at the beginning - what will tell you that this feature is definitely completed? For example, with our navigation bar, is it that it allows us to navigate to the right pages, or is that it has the correct styling with agreed theme colours?
>
> Testing this is part of acceptance criteria but deserves its own category. It can make a world of difference to think about what kind of tests you want to include as part of a particular feature, and will again bring your focus from the beginning to TDD.
> 
> Documentation / Links and any other additional information that will help the developer working on the ticket complete the task e.g. a great tutorial, a template for a navigation bar, the file path for useful code to complete this ticket.
