# WEEK 1 Golden Square

4 Key Software Engineering Practices:

1. TEST DRIVING - Test Driven Development: test first then make it pass on the production code. The test ‘drive’ the implementation
2. OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN - structuring code using objects and classes. Software is created by creating a system of classes that interact to perform the job of the software
3. DEBUGGING - a collection of diff approaches for dealing with situations when code does something I don't intend to for reasons I don’t understand.
4. PAIRING - pair programming

## Weekly Goals

* [x] Set up directory to keep track and document my learning in Makers
* [x] learn basic TDD best practices
* [x] Complete pair programming using GitHub

### Plan

* Create repository in GitHub that will contains files documenting my learning in Makers
* work through phase one: testing bites
* work through some challenges for phase two
* pair program!
* attend workshops

### Evidence

* [Testing Bites](https://github.com/maddc0de/testing-bites)
* [Phase 2 - Test-drived a single method program](https://github.com/maddc0de/test-drive-a-single-method-program)
* [Phase 2 - Designed a single method program](https://github.com/maddc0de/design-single-method)
* [Phase 2 - Test-drived a single Class program](https://github.com/maddc0de/test-drive-a-single-class-program)
* [Phase 2 - Designed a single Class program](https://github.com/maddc0de/design-a-single-class-program)

## Daily Goals

### 14th March

* [x] finish all of phase one: testing bites exercises

### 15th March

* [x] complete some of phase two challenges

### 16th March

* [x] complete [process feedback challenge](https://github.com/maddc0de/design-single-method/blob/main/lib/challenge.rb) with audio on designing a single method program

### 17th March

[x] complete the other [process feedback challenge](https://github.com/maddc0de/design-a-single-class-program/blob/main/lib/music-tracker.rb) on designing a single Class program

## Reflections

### 13th March

At the beginning of the week, we had an introduction to **Emotional Intelligence** and how vital it is to thrive at my learning journey with Makers and after, as I continue to grow and develop professionally and personally. I found this workshop very helpful as it enocouraged me to become more self aware and reflect on my current mindset.

We also had our first video call with everyone from my cohort and the Makers team which helped a lot with calming my own anxieties and worries because of how welcoming everyone was, and how much Makers, itself, values mental health wellness.

### 14th March

First peer group check-in video call! It's nice that we get a prompt of what we can talk about.

### 15th March

Setting up how we were going to pair-program with my pair took longer than the actually coding mainly because of technical issues but I felt good about being able to get to know one of my cohort member better!

### 16th March

Completed the first process feedback challenge and it was very nerve wrecking but I gave my best to work through the discomfort and felt proud of myself for doing so.

I also enjoyed the TDD workshop today! regex looks a whole lot let scary and I have also gained useful tips for good coding practices.

My pair-programming session today had me feeling lost. Moving forward, I should communicate my expectations and needs and should take adequate breaks.

### 17th March

First retrospective with my cohort and we filled in a retro board as a group. Most of the posts resonated with me but I will only mention one from each section:

1. What went well this week?  'Tutorial videos from kay'

2. What was hard this week? 'Figuring out best practices/approach for pairing'

3. What helped overcome the challenges this week? 'discussing problems in peer group check in'

4. What could you do differently next week? 'set boundaries with pairing expectations (break times etc)'

<!-- revisit OOP: Encapsulation - protects data and promotes modularity for better code organisation
-read a bit about functional programming (pure functions, side-effects)
-experiment with regex -->

## Useful Tips

* In RSpec, The purpose of “describe” is to wrap a set of tests against one functionality while “context” is to wrap a set of tests against one functionality under the same state.

* `require_relative` ‘path/to/folder’ is more robust than `require` keyword

* Referential transparency - important practice and concept
