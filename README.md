### I can make a software

-----

* I can TDD anything:

> I take specifications (user stories) and behavioural descriptions provided to guide the test I write first and then the code I write to pass that test. Following the `red`, `green` cycle then `refactor` when needed for a minimal and well-designed code, with maximum test coverage.
>
>This include writing tests that are:
>
> * easy to change,
> * isolated (unit tests),
> * more readable by following a consistent format and writing clear descriptions of the tests

* I can program fluently

> I have the ability to breakdown a problem effectively.
>
> I have a solid grasp of fundamental programming concepts such as Data types, Variables, Control Structures, Functions, Object-Oriented Programming and Debugging.  This understanding allows me to leverage syntax and semantics of programming languages to tackle problems and develop web applications.
>
> I am capable of writing clean, concise and well-organised code that is easy to understand and maintain.
> I am able to understand and collaborate with others on their code through effective pair programming.
> I have the aptitude to quickly learn new programming languages and frameworks.

* I can debug anything

> I have a systematic process to identify error and fix the issue. This involves reproducing the error to identify the specific steps or inputs that triggers the problem combined with getting visibility (for example console logging values in Javascript) helps to isolate the problem and understand its scope.
> This may also involve gathering relevant information as much as possible about the error - understanding the error messages and any other available logs or output.
> Additionally, testing edge cases and different inputs helps me identify scenarios where my code may fail or produce incorrect results.

* I can model anything

> I am able to effectively model and plan programs or systems by breaking down problems. Creating clear diagrams, I can effectively illustrate how different parts of the program or system work together and interact with each other. This allows me to create detailed models that help with planning and development, making the process easier to understand and implement.

* I can refactor anything

>I have the ability to refactor code, making it more readable, maintainable, and adhering to best practices such as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), single responsibility, and testability in isolation. By restructuring the code, I ensure that it is easier to understand, modify, and avoids unnecessary duplication.

* I have a methodical approach to solving problems

> BREAKDOWN PROCESS:
>
> 1. Extract nouns and verbs from user stories: Identify the objects (nouns) and the actions (verbs/methods) required by analyzing the user stories. Creating a table diagram can help visualize this information.
>
> Object      | Methods
> ----------- | ------------
> diary       | read
> diary entry | add
>
> 2. Map `methods` to `objects`: Determine which objects can perform the required actions by mapping the methods to the corresponding objects. This helps identify see which methods can be sent to which objects
> 3. Visualize object interactions: Draw out the interactions between the objects and how they encapsulate their responsibilities. This visualization helps understand the flow and relationships between different components.
>
> 4. Create a series of simple tests: Write down a set of simple test cases that gradually build up the functionality. These tests serve as a guide to ensure each component is implemented correctly and can be used for validation.
>
> 5. Plan and model the class systems: Design the class structure and relationships based on the identified objects and their interactions.
>
> 6. Plan and model the pages and routes: Determine the required pages and routes for the application based on user stories and the desired functionality. This helps create a clear plan for the user interface and navigation.

### I'm equipped for long term growth

-----

* I manage my own wellbeing

> I engage in actiivies outside of programming such as working out, cooking and baking, and minfdulness to help me stay motivated and open to acquiring new skills and knowledge. It also helps me unwind and manage my stress levels.

* I can learn anything by myself

> When faced with unfamiliar technologies or problem domains, I embrace these challenges as opportunities for personal growth. I take it upon myself to explore and gain knowledge in new tools, platforms, and technologies independently. This adaptability enables me to readily embrace emerging technologies and deliver innovative solutions.
> I take responsibility for my own learning journey and proactively seek out resources, setting goals and tracking my progress.

### I help my teams succeed

-----

* I use an agile product development process
* I write code that is easy to change
* I can justify the way I work
* I grow collaboratively
