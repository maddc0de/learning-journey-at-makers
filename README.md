[x] Update my learning tracker in Github
[ ] Complete the Solo Project in the Databases Modules

[Week 5]()

--------------------------------------------------;

#### I can make a software

**I can TDD anything**
To take specifications (user stories) and behavioural descriptions it provides to guide the test I write first and then the code I write to pass that test:

following the ==red==, ==green== cycle then refactor when needed for a minimal and well-designed code, with maximum test coverage.

This include writing tests that are:
> easy to change
> isolated (unit tests)
> more readable by following a consistent format and writing clear descriptions of the tests

**I can program fluently**
This involves being able to breakdown a problem effectively. 


To have a solid grasp of fundamental programming concepts such as Data types, Variables, Control Structures, Functions, Object-Oriented Programming and Debugging.

To have a good understanding of the syntax and semantics of a language, enabling me to leverage these tools to tackle problems and build web applications.

To be capable of writing clean, concise and well-organised code that is easy to understand and maintain.

To be able to understand other people's code and effectively pair program.

To be capable of learning new programming languages and frameworks.

**I can debug anything**
To use a methodical process to identify the error and fix the issue.
To get visibilty -tighten the loop


**I can model anything**

To be able to break down a problem in order to plan a program/system through modelling. This involves being able to diagram effectively how the program/system works/will work, and how it interacts with each other

- **I can refactor anything**

<!-- To making the code more readable, easier to change, and ensuring the practices of DRY code, single responsibility and testing in isolation are implemented as much as is practical. -->

- **I have a methodical approach to solving problems**

BREAKDOWN PROCESS:

1. from user stories, extract nouns and verbs from the user story: nouns = objects,  verbs = messages / methods to send to the objects
(can build a table diagram to understand it)

 Object | Methods
    -------------------- | -----------------------
    diary | read
    diary entry | add

4. map the `methods` to `objects` to see which messages can be sent to which objects
5. draw out how they need to interact (and how the individual objects should encapsulate their concerns)

6. write down series of simples things to build up from (TESTS)

7. Plan and Model the Class Systems

8. Plan and Model the Pages and Routes

#### I'm equipped for long term growth

- **I manage my own wellbeing**

- **I can learn anything by myself**
<!-- To be able to learn anything is to be able to solve a problem in an unfamiliar context. Solving the problem will enable me to learn about that context. This is known as problem-centred learning - learning to solve a problem, rather than learning a subject.

To practice problem-centred learning I have taken problems I have solved previously and solved them again in different contexts (in different languages and technologies). This allows me to use and experiment with familiar patterns and techniques without the added uncertainty of the problem itself. -->

#### 3. I help my teams succeed

- **I use an agile product development process**
- **I write code that is easy to change**
- **I can justify the way I work**
- **I grow collaboratively**
